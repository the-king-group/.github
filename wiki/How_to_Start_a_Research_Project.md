# How to Start a Research Project

## Part I: Reading

### 1. Pick a topic that you’re interested in
- It’s often useful for this topic to sit at the intersection of two ideas, such as polymers and optimization, where you suspect there’s an opportunity to bring those ideas together in a new way.

### 2. Do some background reading on the topic
- Collect papers recommended by people that you know and trust.
- Do a Google Scholar search.
- Use LLMs to get a feel for the literature, but do a deep dive yourself on ideas that seem promising.

### 3. Identify and articulate the cutting edge of the literature
- Identify what opportunities you see (e.g. what is needed or missing, or a new angle that people haven’t tried yet).
- Focus on ways that new methods (e.g. optimization and design) can contribute:
  - New ways of asking questions, or
  - New ways of answering existing questions.

## Part II: Formulate the Problem

### 4. Write down a concrete question to answer
- Discuss the question with collaborators and people whose opinions and experience you trust.

#### a. The question should be impactful
- The fact that a hole exists in the literature is not enough justification to pursue that hole.
- Instead, think about what lines of inquiry will be opened up if you are able to answer this question.
- Impact can range from:
  - New fundamental ideas to explore
  - Interactions with more distant fields
  - Potential impacts on human health or climate change  
- Any impact is good, as long as it inspires you.

#### b. The question needs to be doable
- This is often the hardest part for new researchers.
- One way to assess this is by asking: *“What would my first step be toward answering this question?”*
- If you have clear ideas about where to start, it’s more likely to be doable.

#### c. If possible, choose a question where any outcome is interesting
- If a negative result is boring, it will be harder to publish and harder to continue.
- If all outcomes are interesting:
  - All the work you do pushes toward the impact you’ve identified.
  - The project will be more fun.

#### d. Risk assessment
- It’s not always possible to make all outcomes interesting.
- In that case, assess the balance of risk and reward:
  - How much work will it take to get an answer?
  - If it takes minimal work to determine whether the outcome is interesting, the risk may be worth it.
  - If it will take years, it may not be.
- This also depends on how impactful a positive outcome would be.
- If you take on a risky project, it’s good to have another, less risky project at the same time.

#### e. Get early feedback
- The people around you are your best resource.
- They can:
  - Guide your ideas
  - Point you toward important papers or angles you missed
  - Help refine the impact of your question

### 5. Choose methods and computational tools
- These may evolve, but you should have a clear sense of how you’ll start attacking the problem.

#### a. Validation
- Find a result in the literature to compare against as validation.
- Example:
  - If you’re simulating polymer dynamics, compute diffusion rates under different regimes and compare them to analytical results in the literature.
- This is useful for:
  - Debugging
  - Publishing, since it builds trust in your results.

#### b. Break the problem into steps
- If needed, break the main question into easier, more doable sub-questions.

### 6. Sketch a rough outline of the paper
- Use bullet points only.
- Include:
  - Motivation (impact and how this work contributes)
  - The main question
  - The methods you’ll use
- Roughly hand-sketch the figures you want in the paper:
  - These represent your main results.
  - They serve as guideposts as you do the project.
- Expect this outline to change — that’s normal and often exciting.
- Revisit and update it as results come in.
- Don’t be afraid to change the question.

## Part III: Collect Results

### 7. Collect preliminary validation results
- Compare your method or problem setup to existing results in the literature.

#### a. Ask for help if you get stuck
- This helps you progress faster.
- It also helps you build connections.
- Asking for help is an important part of the scientific process.

### 8. Go beyond the existing literature
- Collect preliminary results that push past what’s already been done.

#### a. Let figures guide your data collection
- Use the figures identified in your paper outline to guide what data you collect.

#### b. Unexpected results are good
- Disagreement with expectations is exciting, not a problem.
- If this happens:
  1. Revisit or expand validation methods to ensure you trust the results.
  2. Return to the literature to see if:
     - Others noticed something similar, or
     - Prior work contains clues to explain your results.
  3. Don’t be afraid to change your question.
     - Update your paper outline with the new direction in mind.

### 9. Create production-quality figures and write the paper
- As ideas solidify, you may notice discrepancies you missed earlier.
- This is expected and valuable.

#### a. Writing clarifies thinking
- Writing helps:
  - Distill ideas
  - Clarify logic
  - Reveal the most important discoveries
- If you notice issues:
  - Go back to the method and address them.
  - Results may change — that’s fine.
  - Return to the paper outline and update it.
- This cycle is a natural part of research, especially when exploring new ideas.

#### b. Get feedback
- Share drafts with people you trust:
  - Peers
  - Collaborators
  - Professors you’d like to get to know better
