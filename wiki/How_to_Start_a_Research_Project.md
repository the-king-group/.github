# How to Start a Research Project

## Part I: Reading

### 1. Pick a topic that you’re interested in
- It’s often useful for this topic to sit at the intersection of two ideas, such as polymers and optimization, where you suspect there’s an opportunity to bring those ideas together in a new way

### 2. Do some background reading on the topic
- Collect papers recommended by people that you know and trust
- Do a Google Scholar search
- You can use LLMs to get a feel for the literature, but do a deep dive yourself on ideas that seem promising

### 3. Identify and articulate the cutting edge of the literature, and what opportunities you see
- For example, determine what is needed or missing, or suggest a new angle that people haven’t tried yet
- Focus on ways that new methods (e.g. optimization and design) can contribute:
  - New ways of asking questions
  - New ways of answering existing questions

## Part II: Formulate the Problem

### 4. Write down a concrete question to answer first
- Discuss the question with your collaborators and people whose opinions and experience you trust

- **a. This question should exist at the cutting edge you identified, and it should be impactful**
  - The fact that a hole exists in the literature is not enough justification to pursue that hole
  - Instead, think about what lines of inquiry will be opened up if you are able to answer this question
  - Impact can range from:
    - New fundamental ideas to explore
    - Interactions with more distant fields
    - Potential impacts on human health or climate change
  - Any impact is good, as long as it inspires you!

- **b. This question needs to be doable**
  - This aspect is often the hardest piece for new researchers to determine
  - One way to explore this is by asking: *“What would my first step be towards answering this question?”*
  - If you have some clear ideas about where to start, it’s more likely to be doable

- **c. If possible, choose a question where any outcome is interesting**
  - If a negative result is boring, that will make it harder to publish and harder to continue
  - If all outcomes are interesting:
    - All the work that you do will push towards the impact you’ve identified
    - It’ll also be more fun for you!

- **d. Assess risk and reward:**
    - Your time is valuable!
    - Ask yourself:
      - How much work will it take to get to an answer?
      - How important and impactful is this result?
    - If it’s minimal work to know whether the outcome will be interesting, it may be worth the risk even if the impact is not that high
    - If it’ll take years of work, then the impact of the result should be correspondingly higher
    - The risk is a lot higher if only a positive outcome is interesting
    - If you take on a risky project, it’s good to have another project that’s less risky at the same time

- **e. Getting early feedback is key**
  - The people around you are your best resource
  - They can:
    - Provide guidance on your ideas
    - Point you towards important papers or angles you missed
    - Help you refine the impact that your question could have

### 5. Choose the methods and computational tools best-suited to answering the question
- These may evolve as you’re working, but you should have a clear sense of how you’re going to start attacking the problem

- **a. Validation**
  - Find a result in the literature that you can compare your results to as validation of the method.
  - For example:
    - If you’re setting up a simulation of polymer dynamics, compute the diffusion rates under different regimes and compare those to analytical results in the literature
  - This is useful for debugging
  - It’s also useful for publishing the work: it’s a way to show an audience that they can trust your results

- **b. Breaking the question into steps**
  - If needed, this is a good time to break up the question you selected into easier, more doable steps

### 6. Sketch a rough outline of the paper you’ll write on the question you selected
- Use bullet points only
- Write down:
  - Your motivation (i.e. the impact you selected and how this contributes to the impact)
  - The main question you’re asking
  - The methods you’ll use
- Very roughly hand-sketch the figures you want in the paper
  - These are your main results
  - They will serve as guideposts when you start doing the project
- This outline is very likely to change as you progress
- That’s completely okay, and is often exciting
- As you get results, revisit this outline and update the ideas as you go
- Don’t be afraid to change the question!

## Part III: Collect Results

### 7. Collect preliminary results that compare your method or problem setup to existing results in the literature
- This validates the method.

- **a. Ask for help if you get stuck**
  - This will help you progress more quickly
  - It will also help you make new connections with people around you
  - Asking for help is an important part of the scientific process

### 8. Push past the existing literature
- Collect preliminary results that go beyond what’s been done before

- **a. Data collection**
  - The data you collect should be guided by the figures you identified when outlining the paper

- **b. Results may disagree with your expectations**
  - That’s not a problem — it’s exciting!
  - In that case, you should:
    - Make sure that you trust the results by revisiting or expanding your validation methods
    - Go back to the literature and see if anyone else has noticed what you’re noticing
    - See if prior work can hold clues that help you understand your results
    - Don’t be afraid to change your question!
    - Return to your rough paper outline and redo it with the new results in mind

### 9. Start creating production-quality figures and filling in the paper outline

- **a. Finalizing ideas**
  - Often, when you start finalizing ideas, you’ll notice discrepancies you missed earlier on.
  - That’s part of the point of writing the paper:
    - It helps distill ideas
    - It clarifies the logic
    - It reveals the most important things you’ve discovered
  - Noticing these things means that the writing is doing its job
  - Take the time to go back to your method and address anything you notice
  - It’s possible this will change the result
  - That’s completely fine!
  - Return to the step of outlining the paper with the new results
  - This cycle is a natural part of the research process
  - When you’re working on ideas no one has ever discovered before, you’re going to get things wrong on the first (and sometimes second, third, or fourth) pass

- **b. Get feedback**
  - Get feedback on the draft from people you trust:
    - Peers
    - Collaborators
    - Professors you want to get to know better
